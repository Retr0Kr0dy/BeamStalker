Introduction
-------------
Welcome to the BeamStalker Documentation. This project is an open-source firmware for esp based boards designed for RF experimentation, encouraging collaboration and ethical exploration. No profit motive here‚Äîjust a project for those who want to mess around with RF tech and hack their way through.

Open-source means you can poke around, modify, and make it your own. It‚Äôs all about collaboration and sharing your findings with the community. Explore, experiment, and push boundaries, but keep it ethical‚Äîdon‚Äôt bring any malicious nonsense into it.

Join in, share your findings, and let‚Äôs see what we can create together. Happy hacking!
