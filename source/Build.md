# Build
This project is designed to be built on any ESP32 chip (adding support for more shouldnâ€™t take too much effort), but it has only been tested on the ESP32 and ESP32-S3 based boards.

Once you have successfully setup your IDE, you can build the project.

> For deauth to work you to do the wsl bypass first. ([See here](https://github.com/Retr0Kr0dy/esp-idf_wsl_bypass))

Clone the project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Retr0Kr0dy/BeamStalker
```

Then prepare your project (Here you can choose settings for your specific hardware):

## Single build

Compiling for specific already handled board : 

```sh
cd BeamStalker/Firmwares/BeamStalker # go to the project directory
cp board/sdkconfig.<your-board> sdkconfig.defaults
idf.py build
```
Your firmware should live at `build/BeamStalker.bin`.

## Build all

For github action to build firmware for all board, we made a simple `build.sh` to build firmware for all board confs in `boards/`.

```sh
./build.sh
```

This script will build all boards available at `boards/` and move them to `bin/BeamStaler-<version>-<board-name>.bin`
