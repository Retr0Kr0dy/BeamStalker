BeamStalker is open-source firmware for esp based boards designed for RF experimentation, encouraging collaboration and ethical exploration. No profit motive here‚Äîjust a project for those who want to mess around with RF tech and hack their way through.

Open-source means you can poke around, modify, and make it your own. It‚Äôs all about collaboration and sharing your findings with the community. Explore, experiment, and push boundaries, but keep it ethical‚Äîdon‚Äôt bring any malicious nonsense into it. 

Join in, share your findings, and let‚Äôs see what we can create together. Happy hacking!

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Currently you have two choices, either you get the latest bin file for you board in the [release section](https://github.com/Retr0Kr0dy/BeamStalker/releases) and flash it to your board, or you can build the project from source using esp-idf v4.4 (see [Get Started](https://retr0kr0dy.github.io/BeamStalker/Setup.html)).

> [!NOTE]
> Work gracefully with the [M5Launcher project](https://github.com/bmorcelli/M5Stick-Launcher).

## üìñ Usage

This project is mainly a CLI giving utlra modular capabilities inspired by this [Shell-ESP32](https://github.com/Eun0us/Shell-ESP32) project.

For more specific usage docs, go check the [wiki](https://retr0kr0dy.github.io/BeamStalker).
